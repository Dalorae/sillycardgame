    Defensive- This unit cannot attack.
        Usage Guidelines:
            Double Power per Energy is an appropriate adjustment for Units with this ability

    Disrupt- If this Permanent would be targeted by an ability or effect, that ability/effect is negated.
        Usage Guidelines:
            Very powerful ability, should be costed inverse to how Deadly scales

    Energize x- When a Card that shares a Aspect with this Card is played this Permanent gains x Energy.
        Usage Guidelines:
            A 1-1 Ratio of Energy Cost and x should be ok with this one, this is weaker than Generate

    Eternal- This Permanent cannot be removed from play while it has this ability.
        Usage Guidelines:
            This is something to put on OP Super Rares only, this should NOT be common

    Generate x- This Permanent produces x Energy on your turn.
        Usage Guidelines:
            Should be at least a 2-1 Ratio between the Energy Cost and x. Potentially More if on a Unit

        Usage Guidelines:
            Too many potentials to provide a good cost adjustment estimate

    Level Up x- Once per turn you may pay x Energy to add a level counter to this unit. Effects of leveling are described on each card.
        Usage Guidelines:
            Level Up itself doesn't really have any effect on the cost of the unit. You balance the leveling benefits with the cost of x

    Modular [Tribe]- You may discard a card to place a [Tribe] Unit Card under this Unit. This Unit gains the Tribes, Aspects, and Abilities of that card in addition to its own.
        Usage Guidelines:
            At this point in time should really only be used on Roboko Cores
            Units with this shouldn't have large Energy Mods and should likely have an Energy Cost of 3 or less since most of their power comes from adding more cards to them

    Morale x [Aspect/Tribe]- Units that share the specified Aspect or Tribe with this Permanent gain x Power while it remains in play.
        Usage Guidelines:
            Morale can be extremely powerful, recommended not to place it on units under 3 cost.

    Piercing- If this unit is defended against any damage exceeding the Opposing Unit's Energy is dealt to the Opponent's Shield.
        Usage Guidelines:
            This Ability costs more the higher the base power of the unit is

    Pilfer x- When this Unit attacks a player undefended reveal the top x card(s) of their deck, you may play them this turn.
        Usage Guidelines:
            Valuable on cheap units, less valuable on big units.

    Progress x- Effect triggers when there are x Progress Counters on this Permanent.
        Usage Guidelines:
            This Ability is really just a trigger for certain Features that require investment.

    Recurring- When this card would enter the grave instead put it on the bottom of your deck.
        Usage Guidelines:
            Not really that powerful, you can likely throw this on a lot of things without needing to mess with costs too much.

    Ritual [Aspect/Tribe]- You can use energy from this Unit to pay the cost for a card that has the specified Aspect or Tribe.
        Usage Guidelines:
            None at this point, hasn't been brain tested or field tested

    Shielded x- If an ability or effect would target this Permanent its controller must pay x or it is negated.
        Usage Guidelines:
            Not too strong an ability, maybe just shave some off the Energy Mod if this is the only ability it has.

    Stealth- This Unit cannot be blocked
        Usage Guidelines:
            This Ability costs more the higher the base power of the unit is

    Tribute x- As an additional cost to play this card sacrifice x Units
        Usage Guidelines:
            Dark or Primal would be the most likely Aspects to utilize this, this frees up some design space for stronger effects like Ordinance Win Conditions

    Uncapped- There is no limit on the number of copies of this card a deck can contain.
        Usage Guidelines:
            Memes

    Undying- You may return this Unit to play from the grave by discarding a card.
        Usage Guidelines:
            Extremely Powerful Ability, Should only be on low Power Units UNLESS Tribute is on the Unit as well

    [Tribe] Unity x- This Unit gains x power for each Unit that shares a specific tribe with it
        Usage Guidelines:
            The value of this depends on the Tribe and the base Power and Energy cost of the Unit
            Putting Unity 1 on a Unit that's already a big boy that costs a lot probably isn't too big a deal but putting it on a 1 coster can be very strong
